# Kuma Multicluster Mesh

This repository provides a detailed guide for deploying [Kuma](https://kuma.io/) in a multicluster environment using Kubernetes. It includes step-by-step instructions for provisioning clusters, setting up the control planes, deploying a demo app, and applying service mesh policies.

## üìê Architecture

The topology features:
- A **Global Control Plane** deployed in a dedicated cluster
- One or more **Zone Control Planes** deployed in other clusters
- Connectivity established using Kuma's built-in multizone support

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Provision Kubernetes Clusters**
   Follow the steps in `00-gke-cluster-provisioning.md` to create the necessary clusters.

2. **Deploy Global Control Plane**
   See `01-central-control-plane.md`.

3. **Deploy Zone Control Planes**
   Refer to `02-zone-control-plane.md`.

4. **Install the Demo Application**
   Guide available in `03-counter-demo-app.md`.

5. **Apply Mesh Policies**
   Configure traffic and observability using the remaining docs.

## üìä Observability

This setup integrates with Prometheus, Jaeger, and Loki for full observability in a distributed mesh. Configuration files are available under:
- `remote-write.yaml`
- `scrape-config.yaml`

## üß∞ Requirements

- Kubernetes clusters (GKE recommended)
- `kubectl`, `helm`, and `kumactl` CLI tools
- Basic knowledge of service meshes and Kubernetes
